                <h2 class="heading">About the shelter “Cozy House”</h2>
                <p>Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands and
                    statistics show that only 20% of them will find a family. The
                    others will continue to live with us and will be waiting for a lucky
                    chance to become dearly loved.
                </p>
                <p>We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they
                    do not get sick, feel comfortable (including psychologically) and
                    well. We are supported by 87 volunteers and 28 employees of
                    various skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by the
                    shelter staff. Taking care of the animals, they become attached
                    to the pets and would hardly ever leave them alone.
